# Portfolio Web UI

This repo contains a lightweight webpage that displays the portfolio performance of
an ETF trading strategy powered by a backend render service.

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### Acknowledgements

Both the backend trading strategy and frontend UI were created by Ben Cohen with the aid
of OpenAI's Codex product.
